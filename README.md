  Keep track of when you wash your hands with the Apple Watch.
</h3>

<br/>

In the light of the current pandemic, washing your hands could be a matter of life and death. The Soap app helps remind you to wash your hands frequently and more. You can also keep track of how often you've washed your hands just by wearing the Apple Watch. That's right! Using machine learning, your Apple Watch will be able to detect when you are washing your hands. That way you can get notified in a smart way. It is a seamless way to that do something that could save your life.

#### Why did you pick this particular organization, institution or individual?

Although the Soap app can be used by anyone with an Apple Watch, I am dedicating this app to help my parents because they seem to underestimate this pandemic. The goal is to get my parents to create a habit of washing their hands frequently.

#### How did you identify the problem to solve and why did you pick this problem over others?

I identified this problem by observing my parent's denial over the lethality of COVID-19. I noticed that as the Indonesian government initially stated that there were zero number of people that were infected; my parents began to make false assumptions that they were safe because the hot weather would have killed the virus. That is why I chose to urgently find a way to mitigate the possibility of being infected over solving others because of its relevance and importance in the ongoing pandemic.

#### Describe your approach. How did you come up with it? Is it the best possible solution? Why?

Before I began ideating, I made three requirements. The solution should be easy to use, influential towards creating a habit of washing our hands and attainable within three weeks. My initial idea was to simply create an app that helps remind me to wash my hands. But this would not differentiate itself from a reminders app.

But then I noticed that both my parents own an Apple Watch. So I looked at the possiblity of using it to make a smart way to remind them to wash their hands. This was when I came up with the idea to detect a hand washing motion using the Apple Watch. The goal is to remind someone who has not washed their hands for sometime and if they have done it, make them feel rewarded. This solution can be used seamlessly day-to-day as it requires no manual user interaction and it's on the right track to be influential towards creating a habit of getting people to wash their hands.

But after using it myself for a week, the pros and cons became apparent. Although it can be used seamlessly on a daily basis, its accuracy to detect a hand washing gesture still needs to be improved. Its reliance on the Apple Watch also limits the number of people that can use it. But overall, it did help remind my parents to wash their hands and it remains to be one of the most user-friendly way for Apple Watch users to create a habit of doing so.


#### Describe your previous skillset. Did you learn anything new in the past three weeks? 

I have been an iOS Developer for over two years but I have never made an app for the Apple Watch nor trained a machine learning model. But in the past three weeks I did just that; I was able to get an Apple Watch to recognize when I am washing my hands. To do this, I had to learn how to properly collect sensor data from the Apple Watch, process it to train a machine learning model and implement it on the watch. Although my machine learning model only has about 90% accuracy, I am very satisfied to know that I am capable of making this and that this concept has actually helped people.
