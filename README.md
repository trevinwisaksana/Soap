## An app that can detect when you wash your hands using the Apple Watch

In the light of the current pandemic, washing your hands could be a matter of life and death.  

I noticed that my parents 

#### Why did you pick this particular organization, institution or individual?

Although the Soap app can be used by anyone with an Apple Watch, I am dedicating this app to help my parents because they seem to underestimate this pandemic. The goal is to get my parents to create a habit of washing their hands frequently.

#### How did you identify the problem to solve and why did you pick this problem over others?

I identified this problem by observing my parent's denial over the lethality of COVID-19. I noticed that as the Indonesian government initially stated that there were zero number of people that were infected, my parents began to make false assumptions that they were safe because the hot weather would have killed the virus. This is why I chose to urgently find a way to mitigate the possibility of being infected over solving others because of its relevance and importance in the ongoing pandemic.

#### Describe your approach. How did you come up with it? Is it the best possible solution? Why?

The initial idea I had was to simply create an app that helps me remind myself to wash my hands. Then a graph would should how often Iâ€™ve done it each day. However, the finicky part would be to remember to log this data every time I wash my hands

#### Describe your previous skillset. Did you learn anything new in the past three weeks? 

I have been an iOS Developer for over two years but I have never made an app for the Apple Watch nor train a machine learning model. But in the past three weeks I did just that; I was able to get an Apple Watch to recognize when I am washing my hands.
