In the light of the current pandemic, washing your hands could be a matter of life and death. The Soap app helps remind you to wash your hands frequently and more. You can also keep track of how often you've washed your hands just by wearing the Apple Watch. That's right! Using machine learning, your Apple Watch will be able to detect when you are washing your hands. That way you can get notified in a smart way. It is a seamless way to that do something that could save your life.

#### Why did you pick this particular organization, institution or individual?

Although the Soap app can be used by anyone with an Apple Watch, I am dedicating this app to help my parents because they seem to underestimate this pandemic. The goal is to get my parents to create a habit of washing their hands frequently.

#### How did you identify the problem to solve and why did you pick this problem over others?

I identified this problem by observing my parent's denial over the lethality of COVID-19. I noticed that as the Indonesian government initially stated that there were zero number of people that were infected; my parents began to make false assumptions that they were safe because the hot weather would have killed the virus. That is why I chose to urgently find a way to mitigate the possibility of being infected over solving others because of its relevance and importance in the ongoing pandemic.

#### Describe your approach. How did you come up with it? Is it the best possible solution? Why?

Before I began ideating, I made three requirements. The solution should be easy to use, influential towards create a habit to wash our hands and attainable within three weeks. My initial idea was to simply create an app that helps remind me to wash my hands. But this would not differentiate itself from a reminders app.

But then, I noticed that both my parents own an Apple Watch. So I thought of making a smart way to remind them to wash their hands. One that doesn't spam them with notifications. After doing some research on the feasability of detecting a hand washing motion using the Apple Watch, I decided to 

#### Describe your previous skillset. Did you learn anything new in the past three weeks? 

I have been an iOS Developer for over two years but I have never made an app for the Apple Watch nor trained a machine learning model. But in the past three weeks I did just that; I was able to get an Apple Watch to recognize when I am washing my hands. To do this, I spent 6 minutes non-stop pretending to wash my hands and another 6 minutes doing other activities to gather the movement data from the Apple watch. Although my machine learning model only has about 90% accuracy, I am very satisfied to know that I can capable of making this.
